# MATLAB Image Processing & Computer Vision Labs

This repository contains my course-based image processing and computer vision lab assignments implemented in **MATLAB**, covering foundational and advanced techniques using the Image Processing Toolbox.

##  Overview

Each lab demonstrates a classic image processing technique, with code, results, and visual outputs included. The collection spans a variety of topics, structured for clarity and ease of use:

1. **Color Image Conversions & 2D Function Plotting**  
2. **Brightness & Contrast Manipulation (RGB Images)**  
3. **Grayscale Transformations: Log, Power-Law, Contrast Stretching**  
4. **Gray Level Slicing & Bit Plane Slicing**  
5. **Spatial Filtering for Image Restoration**  
6. **High-Pass Filtering Techniques**  
7. **Edge Detection: Prewitt & Sobel Operators**  
8. **Edge Detection: Sobel, Canny, Marrâ€“Hildreth (LoG)**  
9. **Image Sharpening: Laplacian, Unsharp Masking, High-Boost**  
10. **Frequency-Domain Analysis: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**  
11. **Morphological Operations: Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing**
